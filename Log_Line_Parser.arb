# In this exercise you'll be processing log-lines.
# 
# Each log line is a string formatted as follows: "[<LEVEL>]: <MESSAGE>".
# There are three different log levels:
# 
# INFO
# WARNING
# ERROR
# 
# You have three tasks, each of which will take a log line and ask you to do something with it. 
# There are lots of ways to solve these tasks - choose your favourite methods from the examples above and see what you can come up with.
# 1. Get message from a log line
# 2. Get log level from a log line
# 3. Reformat a log line

class LogLineParser
    attr_reader :message, :log_level, :reformat
    
    def initialize(line)
      @line = line
      groups = /\[(?<level>[A-Z]+)\]:\s+(?<msg>.+)/.match(@line)
      @log_level = groups[:level].downcase
      @message = groups[:msg].strip
      @reformat = "#{@message} (#{@log_level})"
    end
